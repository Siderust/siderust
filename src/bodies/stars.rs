//! Star type and related functionality.
//!
//! Represents stars with name, distance, mass, radius, luminosity, and target.
//! - `name`: Name of the star (borrowed or owned).
//! - `distance`: LengthUnit from Earth in light-years (`LightYear`).
//! - `mass`: Stellar mass in solar masses (`SolarMass`).
//! - `radius`: Stellar radius in solar radii (`SolarRadius`).
//! - `lumminosity`: Stellar luminosity in solar luminosities (`SolarLuminosity`).
//! - `target`: [`Target`] pointing to a Spherical coordinates (see [`Position`]), using degrees and Julian Day.
